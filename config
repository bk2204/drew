# This is a configuration file to determine which plugins are built.  If you
# want a plugin to be built, set the appropriate variable to "m".  Also, some
# plugins offer multiple algorithms.  For example, the sha512 plugin offers both
# SHA-384 and SHA-512.

# Note that the aes plugin implements Rijndael (the AES algorithm) with key
# sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits and a block size of 128 bits.  The rijndael
# plugin offers all five block sizes and all five key sizes, but runs at about
# one-third of the speed.  You do not need both.
