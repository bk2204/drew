/* This structure is used for passing parameters to algorithms that need them.
 * The name of a parameter and its values are specified in SCAN.  Names are
 * case-sensitive.  Parameters specified as Integer or long in SCAN are stored
 * in number; those specified as String are passed in String; and those
 * specified as arrays or objects are specified as value.  Arrays of long in
 * SCAN are arrays of uint64_t; arrays of byte are uint8_t.
 *
 * Note that key lengths for symmetric ciphers are not specified in this manner
 * for compliance with SCAN.  Instead, they are passed via a separate argument.
